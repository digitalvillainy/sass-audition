## Sass-audtion submission from Roberto Rivera

Thank you for your time and consideration.

# Primer before review:
I approached the audition with two ideas in mind:
1. I wanted any of the sass that I write to not only be reusable but should conform to a larger style strategy. Meaning
that by the end of it we would have a design bible that fits the current corporate aesthetic.
   
2. Using things like bootstrap/ tailwind/ etc normally causes the value of class per html element to be like a large 
   paragraph. Therefore, I wanted to extend the functionality while leaving room to customize outside the typical bootstrap style.
   

## Additional Note!

I wasn't sure if it was the intention of the one who built this project to share their .idea file, 
but I chose to exclude mine. Often I find that it messes with another users settings if their using PHPStorm or similar 
Jetbrains IDE. This was an roundabout way of justifying why I added the .idea file to .gitignore. Just a heads up.
